# About

### The technical stuff üë®üèº‚Äçüíª
This page was built with the [Astro framework](https://astro.build/), which I highly recommend for content-heavy pages, like this.

It's hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), which is a free hosting provider (for personal projects like this), with many cool features, such as deployment from Github.


### My story üçÄ
TLDR; You can find my Curriculum Vitae right [here](/cv.pdf).

Now to the stuff that you actually got here for!

#### The beginning
I was born in Herning, DK on the 25th of June 1985, which in time of writing makes me 38 years old. Time travels!

I was raised by a loving but stern father, and for the first 13 years, also a loving mother. Luckily she did not pass away just yet, but when I started forming my own opinions and going my own ways and neither aligned with her visions, our relationship went less loving and more distant. That happens, and in an age of 38, I'm at peace with that.

I completed primary school in a pretty average manor, and went straight for high school. Since my motivation for school was basically non-existant, I dropped out after completing the first year, and started working as an auto mechanic. I completed the education, and worked for two more years (six in total), after which I have had enough of being dirty, being cold and hard labor.

#### The middle years

Back in primary school, three friends and I permenently set up our computers in my parents basement. We hooked them up in a LAN, ordered a state-of-the art ADSL connection (512/512) and went all-in on gaming, mostly Counter-Strike and Diablo 2 (it was pre-WoW times, thankfully, otherwise we might not have made it out). 

Gaming can be very anti-social, but bringing your computers together for a LAN-party typically means connecting with people with same interest. I'm not a fan of anti-social gaming (grinding WoW alone or with people you've never met and never will), but playing with friends that you connect with, can only work to tighten your relationship. I'm still playing the casual Warzone game with friends now and then when my schedule allows it.
