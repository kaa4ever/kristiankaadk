# About

### The technical stuff 👨🏼‍💻
This page was built with the [Astro framework](https://astro.build/), which I highly recommend for content-heavy pages, like this.

The page is compiled through [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), pushed to a private repository on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) and the served on the cheapest [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) pod available. Easy, fast and very cheap :)

### My story
TLDR; You can find my Curriculum Vitae right here.</p>
Also, if you want to build a professionel looking CV, 100% for free, check out my Curriculum Vitae generator project right <a href="/project/curriculum-vitae-generator">here</a>. You'll also receive some free advice of what to include in your CV.</p>

Now to the stuff that actually got here for!
