A few weeks back, I read Andrei Taranchenkos article _Death by a thousand microservices_ and Justin Etheredges‚Äô _Gasp! You Might Not Need Microservices_, which are both excellent articles. I have been wanting to write this article for a while now, and after reading those two I decided it was finally time.

I was formerly the co-founder and CTO of TestaViva, where I made the decision to move from a monolith to microservices five years back. This article will be a set of practical pros and cons for choosing microservices, based on my experiences.

This article will discuss the following aspects:

Let's go :)

### Why did we move to microservices
At TestaViva we were not flush with money, and we didn‚Äôt board the microservice hype train just because of that hype nor because anyone telling us we should. I made that decision because I wrongfully believed it would solve some real-life problems. Microservices seemed to bring all the solutions, with a minimum of downsides. When reading the articles above, especially Etheredges, it seems like a classic example of wanting to move fast but ending up just as slow, or maybe even slow, than before.  
The problems we faced were:

- Slow-running test suite.
- An out-of-date framework
- Needlessly complex code

Besides solving these problems, I figured the advantages we would gain from microservices would be:
- Motivated developers
- Service scalability
- Easy separation of code ownership

The strategy was simple; every time we added features or refactored code in the monolith, we would branch out and create a new microservice. Basically, I introduced a code freeze in the monolith. This was back in 2018, and we were in no immediate time rush. The only real deadline we had was the end of life for our framework. That was three years into the future and that seemed like light-years away. 

### Things I liked about microservices.
There were things that I liked very much about the shift to microservices, besides the fact it felt extremely cool to brand TestaViva as working with microservices. Unfortunately these things wasn't related to the technical aspects of microservices.

#### Recruitment
Back in 2018, we were running a Symfony 3.4 monolith. If you have been part of the PHP community for the past years you probably have heard of Symfony, but you probably also know that it lost the race to Laravel. To back this statement, Laravel currently has 115% more stars on GitHub than Symfony.

The past year the market has definitely changed from an employee‚Äôs market to an employer's market. I wouldn‚Äôt say that it was impossible to find Symfony developers back then, but it was very clear that Laravel openings just attracted more talent (but also more ‚ÄúLaravel developers‚Äù, which I don‚Äôt think you always want to attract, but that‚Äôs another story).

Making the move to a microservice setup, made us brand ourselves as a Laravel product and team. Sure, you were told that you‚Äôd probably have to maintain some Symfony services but eyeing the chance of rolling your own Laravel services, worked well as a selling point.

Furthermore, branding TestaViva as working with microservices also added value. I‚Äôve actually had one developer specifically joining the team to learn more about microservices and work with the architecture.

#### Software engineer responsibility and progression

Being a start-up often makes it difficult to compete with high salaries, so you need to attract and motivate talent by other means. There are many ways to achieve this, but giving engineers responsibility and enabling them to try out new technologies will often work towards that.

Microservices make it very easy to do both since you often find yourself rolling new services, which brings opportunities to try new frameworks (depending on your developer strategy of course). I‚Äôve literally had developers telling me that they ___loved___ their current tasks since they where building new services from scratch and having a big impact on the layout and architecture of that new service.

### Things I thought we would get, but that we didn‚Äôt get.

Unfulfilled dreams üíî 

#### Staying up to date with the latest security updates

Our monolith was getting old fast, and years of neglecting updates resulted in having to update two major versions. We tried a few times, which basically resulted in too many failing tests, and really, we didn‚Äôt want to lose focus on building our product. 

When I left TestaViva the monolith, although smaller than in its prime, is still going strong. And unless the new CTO can do magic (he is a talented guy, so who knows) it will continue to go strong, for a looong time. 

With microservices, instead of having to update one framework, the tech team now had to maintain and update +20 microservices. The codebases and test suites are smaller of course, but do it 20 times, and my bet is that no time is really saved in the end.

#### Less complex code

The original core of the monolith was developed by a Polish software team, and although they did a good job, they also did some over-engineering in parts of the monolith. 

By separating into microservices we would get a good chance to refactor the complicated parts. I personally put my best engineering talents into building our very first microservice (well, second actually, the first one being a microservice that would keep track of the versions of our future microservices). As someone passionate about automated testing, I implemented the Humble Object design pattern for that microservice. 

This served us well for a while until feature creep crept in and too many different developers made the pattern implementation fall apart. Honestly, now that microservice is just one big mess. Complex, and over-engineered. 

It would seem that microservices can't do magic, and solve complexity ü™Ñ

### Things I thought we would like, but that we really didn‚Äôt need.  

Spending more time on thinking it through, would probably have surfaced these findings before starting the implementation. Nevertheless, it would seem that we were not the only ones thinking we would benefit from some of the cool stuff microservices provides.

#### Service scalability

_Don‚Äôt solve problems you don‚Äôt have._  
Yes, we could scale independent parts of our platform, but not once in my five years with microservice did we have to do that.

In TestaViva's case, we did have one relevant use case. We had a partner who inside a WebView in their native app integrated a small, encapsulated part of TestaViva. Originally, we had built that feature in the monolith, meaning it would boot a lot of unnecessary stuff. 

Moving to microservices, we decided to put that part into its own microservice. This did decrease the time to first paint from around 1200ms to around 600ms, making the overall feel of the implementation much better and more respondent. But running a monolith doesn‚Äôt equal not separating logic and concerns by running multiple services.

The next time I‚Äôm CTO for any product, we will keep our monolith, but still roll separate services, when use-cases like this arises.

#### Easy separation of code ownership

Having repositories that contain one service, makes it easy to assign the responsibility for that service to specific teams. But truth be told, with small teams and relatively small codebases like TestaViva, I‚Äôm unsure about the benefits you get from separating the codebase?

You do gain quality and velocity by having the authors maintain it, no doubt. But with small teams, I‚Äôm afraid that you also end up blocking each other‚Äôs progress too often, which can be much worse than moving slow. It will also be an easy excuse for not fixing stuff. (_"I would do task X, but I‚Äôm waiting on team Y"_). 

### Challenges, downsides, and straight-up problems we faced

Unfortunately, it turned out that microservices brought a lot more challenges and straight-up problems than benefits. I‚Äôm sure that a lot of more talented CTOs, more talented people, and better organized teams out there really love microservices and their microservices implementation, but it was not a perfect fit, not even a good fit, for us. 

#### Integrations tests  - LOL

At TestaViva (and its predecessor, Sikkerarv) we have always enjoyed the benefits of a solid CI workflow and day-to-day releases. When I left TestaViva, that was still the case, but with more pain and suffering than we used to have. 

The integration tests became more and more flaky, primarily because we did not solve the problem of test dependencies that microservices brings along. We also started purposely skipping some would-have-brought-value integration tests, just because it was near impossible to write them. Flaky tests and skipping tests are the direct route to ~~hell~~ a less stable product, and the direct route to me losing sleep.

It's a little difficult to explain, and if you don‚Äôt care about the technicalities and just trust my written word, you can safely [skip to the next part](#valuable-time-wasted-on-devops).

An API should be stable, and in most cases our API was stable. Since our API was not consumed by any external partners, it was sometimes easier to cut corners and alter them anyway.  
Even if no APIs were altered, bugs were sometimes introduced, which didn‚Äôt get picked up by the test suite in the microservice itself, and therefore made their way into production. 

Both cases resulted in other microservices that depended on the now faulty microservice starting to fail their test suites. Or Sentry would start picking up errors. Or our users would. The worst scenario was the last of course (our users suffering) but in all three scenarios it was too late; the bug was in production.

There are ways to fix this, I‚Äôm aware, but we just couldn‚Äôt find the time to implement that in our workflow, and we were already paying way too much for our CI runner. To mitigate this just a bit, we introduced nightly runs of the test suites of all our microservices. But that‚Äôs really like popping a painkiller or peeing in your pants to stay warm.

It's just too complicated.

#### Valuable time wasted on DevOps

I personally ended up writing a whole DevOps service in bash and Python that did nothing but assist our developers in their day-to-day work with the microservices. It brought a lot of convenience features, making their life better, but only because their life was bad due to the complexity added by the microservice architecture in the first place. It‚Äôs not a paradox, it‚Äôs just plain stupid. 

To make matters worse, in my role as CTO I was supposed to:

- Guide the team and improve our much-valued talent.
- Dive into product development and make all my LegalTech experience matter.
- Create state-of-the-art legal tech products.

Of course I did spend my time doing that, but too much time went into maintaining a DevOps repository with helper tools we didn't need in the first place. (Nothing doesn‚Äôt come from something ‚Äì it did raise my level in Python, of which I'm very fond). 

#### Working on multi-service features and the configuration hell

Working on a feature that involves only one microservice is easy (duh). Working with two is also alright. But when you need to balance 3+ microservices, things start getting messy. 

![Configuration hell of microservices](/images/blog/microservices-configuration.jpg)

By nature, they all have their own databases, and some of them also have their own frontends. So, you would need to make sure the configuration for the JavaScript compiler was linked correctly and all the environment variables configured with all the right links between the microservices. And there could be multiple links between microservices, private and public.

Too often you would end up being puzzled about why it would seem that something was off, even though things were working. This was almost always due to the fact that you missed one of these links and requests was either going nowhere or going to one of our shared development services (making it work, just not the way you would expect).

When you became more traversed in our setup, the occurrences of faults related to misconfiguration became rare, but it would still happen, and for new developers (even senior ones) it was a steep learning curve. 

#### Maintaining boilerplate code

When you have a monolith and maybe a few other services, doing scaffolding is not something you need to do often. When you are migrating from a monolith to microservices, and are trying to microservicefy everything, maintaining boilerplate code suddenly became a recurring task.

Taranchenkos has a pretty good list of things you need to do every time you roll a new microservice, and that list is almost a carbon copy of our list. 

Working smarter, not harder, made us set up boilerplate repositories with prebuilt services we needed (Frontend, Symfony, Laravel). 

![Scaffolding repository](/images/blog/scaffolding.jpg)

Very nice, except every time you rolled a new service, you had to update:

- Get rid of the stuff you didn‚Äôt need in your service.
- Update all dependencies to the latest versions.
- Update all dependencies in the boilerplate itself, to decrease the chance that the next developer would need to update by roughly 1%.

Hard work.

### It was my decision, and I was wrong

In the end it turned out that microservices only solved one half of our original problems (slow running tests) and only added one of the benefits (motivated developers). The other problems were either not solved, or just replaced by the same problems with a different flavor. And a lot of unexpected challenges and problems were brought to the table.

So yeah, I was wrong. If I were to go back, I would stop myself from making that decision. If anyone from TestaViva is reading this, please start the process of reverting now. 

At least I know now that my next product will be a monolith, and I‚Äôll be happy about it, also when the next microservice hype train arrives in 10-20 years (because when you stick around long enough, you realize that everything is just a recursion).

##### Post Scriptum: The slow running tests

At the time we started our migration to microservices, our test suite had a runtime of approximately 45 minutes. It was beginning to make our CI workflow more painful. 
Since the CI workflow would need to run twice for a production build, correcting bugs would require at least two hours of waiting. That was really frustrating for both the business and the developers (me included).

Turned out it wasn‚Äôt the monolith that was the cause of the problems, it was the design of our test suite.

A well-designed test suite looks like this:

Our test suite looked like this:

And how did this happen? Again, ignorance. 

In 2015 when the Polish team built our product, they asked me if it was okay for them to write Behat tests instead of PHPUnit tests. We argued back and forth, but in the end the winning argument was that they would move faster (and thereby cheaper) with Behat instead of PHPUnit. 
I was young(er) and inexperienced in software testing. Today I would never have allowed it, but instead bought them a software testing course.

### The end

If no one ever makes it this far, at least I had a lot of fun writing it :)
